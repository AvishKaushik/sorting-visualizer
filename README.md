# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! This is a web application designed to make it easy for users to learn about different algorithms and approaches to sort an array. All the algorithms basically contains 3 common steps which are selection of numbers, comparison between numbers and swapping the numbers. These things are displayed by using variety of colors in the visualizer to make it more easy to understand.

## How does this works?

This web application is designed using ReactJS and several other libraries. This project contains a window which will contain our array and are represented by a bar and it's value is written on the top of the bar.

There are several functions we can perform in the application. This includes a function which will generate a random array of same size.

The second feature consist of a drop down menu which will display us the working of particular algorithm is sorting the given array. The drop-down menu consist of the given algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Comb Sort
3. Cycle Sort
4. Gnome Sort
5. Heap Sort
6. Insertion Sort
7. Merge Sort
8. Pigeonhole Sort
9. Quick Sort
10. Radix Sort
11. Selection Sort
12. Shell Sort

Another feature comes as an adjustable size of the array. A slider is given to generate a randomize array of required size. The maximum possible size for an array can be 40 and the minimum limit will be 4.

With adjustable size, adjustable speed comes in handy for this application as we will need more speed while sorting larger size of array because slow speed can take a lot of time. Also, smaller size with slow speed will make it easier and faster to understand.

***Note: It is advised to prefer slower speed for smaller size of array and faster speed for larger size of array.***
